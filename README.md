# Patient Consent Management API

The Patient Consent Management (PCM) API is one of the core components of the Consent2Share (C2S) application. The PCM provides APIs for patients to manage their electronic consents including consent creation, consent audit, consent eSignature, consent export, and patient provider list management. An electronic patient consent is a digital agreement created and electronically signed by the patient to do the following:

1. Select which *sensitive categories* of health information he or she wishes to share
2. Select the *purposes* for which the medical information may be used
3. Identify the provider *from* whom the information can be disclosed
4. Identify the provider *to* whom the information can be disclosed
5. Record the date when the consent *goes into effect*
6. Identify the *expiration date* of the consent

The value sets, downloaded from [VSAC](https://vsac.nlm.nih.gov/), are a set of concept codes mapped to various *sensitive categories* that are intended for use by organizations exchanging personally identifiable protected health information to perform data segmentation based on the patientâ€™s privacy preferences in his or her consent.

## Build

### Prerequisites

+ [Oracle Java JDK 8 with Java Cryptography Extension (JCE) Unlimited Strength Jurisdiction Policy](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)
+ [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/) (for building a Docker image from the project)

### Commands

This is a Maven project and requires [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) 3.3.3 or greater to build it. It is recommended to use the *Maven Wrapper* scripts provided with this project. *Maven Wrapper* requires an internet connection to download Maven and project dependencies for the very first build.

To build the project, navigate to the folder that contains `pom.xml` file using terminal/command line.

+ To build a JAR:
    + For Windows, run `mvnw.cmd clean install`
    + For *nix systems, run `mvnw clean install`
+ To build a Docker Image (this will create an image with `bhits/pcm:latest` tag):
    + For Windows, run `mvnw.cmd clean package docker:build`
    + For *nix systems, run `mvnw clean package docker:build`

## Run

### Prerequisites

This API uses *[MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/)* for persistence and *[Flyway](https://flywaydb.org/)* for database migration. It requires having a database user account with Object and DDL Rights to a schema with default name `pcm`. Please see [Configure](#configure) section for details of configuring the data source. This API also uses *[ClamAV](http://www.clamav.net/)* anti-virus engine to scan clinical documents. It can be setup by using *[docker-clamavd](https://hub.docker.com/r/dinkel/clamavd/)* and also can be installed on server. Please see *[Installing ClamAV](http://www.clamav.net/documents/installing-clamav)* for details

### Commands

This is a [Spring Boot](https://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/) project and serves the API via an embedded Tomcat instance. Therefore, there is no need for a separate application server to run this service.
+ Run as a JAR file: `java -jar pcm-x.x.x-SNAPSHOT.jar <additional program arguments>`
+ Run as a Docker Container: `docker run -d bhits/pcm:latest <additional program arguments>`

*NOTE: In order for this API to fully function as a microservice in C2S Application, it is also required to setup the dependency microservices and support level infrastructure. Please refer to the C2S Deployment Guide for instructions to setup the C2S infrastructure.*

## Configure

This API runs with some default configuration that is primarily targeted for development environment. However, [Spring Boot](https://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/) supports several methods to override the default configuration to configure the API for a certain deployment environment.

Please see the [default configuration](pcm/src/main/resources/application.yml) for this API as a guidance and override the specific configuration per environment as needed. Also, please refer to [Spring Boot Externalized Configuration](http://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/boot-features-external-config.html) documentation to see how Spring Boot applies the order to load the properties and [Spring Boot Common Properties](http://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/common-application-properties.html) documentation to see the common properties used by Spring Boot.

### Examples for Overriding a Configuration in Spring Boot

#### Override a Configuration Using Program Arguments While Running as a JAR:

+ `java -jar pcm-x.x.x-SNAPSHOT.jar --server.port=80 --spring.datasource.password=strongpassword`

#### Override a Configuration Using Program Arguments While Running as a Docker Container:

+ `docker run -d bhits/pcm:latest --server.port=80 --spring.datasource.password=strongpassword`

+ In a `docker-compose.yml`, this can be provided as:
```yml
version: '2'
services:
...
  pcm.c2s.com:
    image: "bhits/pcm:latest"
    command: ["--server.port=80","--spring.datasource.password=strongpassword"]
...
```
*NOTE: Please note that these additional arguments will be appended to the default `ENTRYPOINT` specified in the `Dockerfile` unless the `ENTRYPOINT` is overridden.*

### Enable SSL

For simplicity in development and testing environments, SSL is **NOT** enabled by default configuration. SSL can easily be enabled following the examples below:

#### Enable SSL While Running as a JAR

+ `java -jar pcm-x.x.x-SNAPSHOT.jar --spring.profiles.active=ssl --server.ssl.key-store=/path/to/ssl_keystore.keystore --server.ssl.key-store-password=strongkeystorepassword`

#### Enable SSL While Running as a Docker Container

+ `docker run -d -v "/path/on/dockerhost/ssl_keystore.keystore:/path/to/ssl_keystore.keystore" bhits/pcm:latest --spring.profiles.active=ssl --server.ssl.key-store=/path/to/ssl_keystore.keystore --server.ssl.key-store-password=strongkeystorepassword`
+ In a `docker-compose.yml`, this can be provided as:
```yml
version: '2'
services:
...
  pcm.c2s.com:
    image: "bhits/pcm:latest"
    command: ["--spring.profiles.active=ssl","--server.ssl.key-store=/path/to/ssl_keystore.keystore", "--server.ssl.key-store-password=strongkeystorepassword"]
    volumes:
      - /path/on/dockerhost/ssl_keystore.keystore:/path/to/ssl_keystore.keystore
...
```

*NOTE: As seen in the examples above, `/path/to/ssl_keystore.keystore` is made available to the container via a volume mounted from the Docker host running this container.*

### Override Java CA Certificates Store In Docker Environment

Java has a default CA Certificates Store that allows it to trust well-known certificate authorities. For development and testing purposes, one might want to trust additional self-signed certificates. In order to override the default Java CA Certificates Store in a Docker container, one can mount a custom `cacerts` file over the default one in the Docker image as `docker run -d -v "/path/on/dockerhost/to/custom/cacerts:/etc/ssl/certs/java/cacerts" bhits/pcm:latest`

*NOTE: The `cacerts` references given in the volume mapping above are files, not directories.*

## Notes

Currently, the Value Set Service (VSS) domain and APIs are a part of PCM API. The VSS is planned to be refactored as a separate Consent2Share microservice in the future.
